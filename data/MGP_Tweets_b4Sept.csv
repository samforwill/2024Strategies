142,"Jul 21, 2022","Today, 
@HerreraBeutler
 celebrated the end of Roe by voting against a bill to protect our access to contraceptives- one thing we can all agree actually prevents abortion. Jaime is not a moderate and has failed to give #WA03 the representation we deserve."

146,"Jul 19, 2022","There is a strong base of Democrats in our district and as a rural democrat who works in the trades, I am the candidate who can flip this seat. Kent is far too extreme & Jaime has been a no-show when we need her the most. SW WA deserves real representation. Let’s flip #WA03"

152,"Jul 7, 2022","Hope is the driving force when you’re up against a field of extremist candidates. #WA03 is tired of Jaime Herrera Beutler and Joe Kent is far too extreme for our district. I know we can flip this seat blue! Thank you,

I, like so many, suffered a miscarriage just two years ago.

160,"Jun 24, 2022","Without access to safe reproductive care, I could have died or suffered complications that could have prevented me from ever going on to have a successful pregnancy. Without the care Planned Parenthood provided that day, I may not be a mother today.  #WomensRights #RoeVsWade"
161,"Jun 24, 2022","In congress, I will take on politicians who try to get between a woman and her doctor and fight to protect abortion rights that the Supreme Court put in jeopardy. It’s more important than ever that mothers like me stand up for our rights."
