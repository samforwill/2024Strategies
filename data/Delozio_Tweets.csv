5,"Nov 8, 2022","I just joined my family to proudly vote for our common good, our freedom, and our shared prosperity here in #PA17. Together, I know that we can keep fighting to make America the land of hope and dreams for all of us. Let‚Äôs go!"

8,"Nov 7, 2022",Corporate executive Jeremy Shaffer really can't stand to be asked about his business in China (or Saudi Arabia!). Corporations like the one that made him rich are raking in millions building up China's infrastructure & selling out folks from #PA17. Need proof? Here:

13,"Nov 7, 2022","My opponent ü§ù Hurting #PA17 seniors

If elected, Shaffer will join other radical Republicans to put Social Security on the chopping block and undermine seniors' health care by cutting Medicare. 

I won't let that stand. Our seniors deserve better."
14,"Nov 6, 2022","It's despicable that Jeremy Shaffer would stand with Pat Toomey over veterans in #PA17, a guy who tried to block benefits for veterans like me exposed to burn pits in war zones. #PA17Debate"
15,"Nov 6, 2022","Great to have 
@francoharrishof

20,"Nov 5, 2022","Folks in #PA17 may be changing their clocks back an hour tonight, but that doesn't mean we have to move this district back 50 years by letting my extremist opponent ban abortion nationwide.

This election will determine our future. Go vote!"
21,"Nov 5, 2022","üó≥Ô∏èElection Day is just days away, #PA17üó≥Ô∏è. So make a plan to vote, vote for Democrats up and down the ballot, and tell everyone you know to do the same!

25,"Nov 4, 2022","Shaffer didn't have the spine to be honest with voters about his support for Oz in the #PA17Debate, yet is standing on a stage with him today.

I don't know what Jeremy learned where he's from, but growing up in #PA17 you and I learned about honesty and courage."

27,"Nov 4, 2022","Seniors in #PA17 deserve a Congressman who will fight for them and their hard-earned benefits. 

I will always protect Social Security and Medicare and take on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug costs‚Äîbecause that's what it means to put Pennsylvanians first."
28,"Nov 4, 2022",We don't need right-wing politicians like Shaffer & Mastriano having anything to say about your reproductive & health care decisions. These extremists want to attack abortion rights if they get power & will lie through their teeth to get there. Let's beat em! #PA17Debate #PA17
29,"Nov 4, 2022","We have to fight the corporate jagoffs ripping us off, sitting on record profits that we're all paying for. They already have enough yes-men working for 'em in Congress; they don't need another one like my #PA17 corporate executive opponent."
30,"Nov 3, 2022","I risked my life for this country because I believe in America. The patriotism I learned growing up right here in #PA17 demands we fight for our common good.

‚òëÔ∏èend the lousy trade deals 

‚òëÔ∏èfight corporate price gouging"
36,"Nov 2, 2022","It was a great afternoon to knock some doors in Harmar. Spoke to a bunch of folks, lots of worry that the GOP is coming for Social Security. I won't let that happen. #PA17"
37,"Nov 2, 2022",These insane Republican threats to Social Security and Medicare would send millions of retirees into poverty. I'll fight them tooth and nail when I'm your #PA17 Congressman.

58,"Oct 28, 2022",The Supreme Court has undone decades of precedent in Roe to attack reproductive freedom. They‚Äôve been attacking workers‚Äô rights for years and made unlimited corporate money free speech. People have lost confidence and feel powerless. We need reform! #PA17Debate
59,"Oct 28, 2022","Jeremy Shaffer is campaigning with election deniers - people who will do everything to undermine our elections, our democracy, and the integrity of YOUR VOTE. #PA17Debate"
60,"Oct 28, 2022",I have young daughters. I don‚Äôt want Doug Mastriano & Jeremy Shaffer to ever have a say in their reproductive or healthcare decisions. They are extremists who support national abortion bans & are threatening to put women and doctors in prison.
61,"Oct 28, 2022",I will do everything I can to protect women‚Äôs freedom! #PA17Debate
62,"Oct 28, 2022","Jeremy, why do you refuse to denounce the insurrection? Why won‚Äôt you denounce the assault on our democracy??? Time and time again you‚Äôve had the opportunity and you have refused. People who won‚Äôt denounce it are a threat to America. #PA17Debate"
63,"Oct 28, 2022",Corporations need to stop ripping us off. Too many corps don‚Äôt pay a dime in income tax & ship our jobs overseas.
64,"Oct 28, 2022",Republicans like Jeremy Shaffer are ok with that and have signed pledges to never raise taxes on these companies. This hurts western PA families and does nothing to bring costs down and bring jobs home. #PA17Debate
65,"Oct 28, 2022","The weapons of war that my friends and I carried in Iraq should not be allowed in our schools, our churches, or in our streets! Period. #PA17Debate"

67,"Oct 28, 2022","Let me be clear - I totally support funding for local police departments! I know what it‚Äôs like to wear a uniform and carry a gun to keep us safe and am proud to be backed by unions for cops, firefighters, and prosecutors. #PA17Debate"

69,"Oct 28, 2022",Jeremy Shaffer has made a fortune building roads and bridges (even nuclear power) in Communist China. We need to get tough on China and invest in jobs and infrastructure right here in America! #PA17Debate
70,"Oct 28, 2022",Jeremy Shaffer - western PA is still waiting for an answer to this question. Do you or don‚Äôt you support Dr. Oz for Senate and Doug Mastriano for Governor? #PA17Debate
71,"Oct 28, 2022",Tune in to the first #PA17Debate TONIGHT! Here is how to watch:

75,"Oct 27, 2022","Shaffer campaigns with insurrectionists, takes money from insurrectionists, and has 20+ members of Congress who voted to throw out our votes in 2020 bankrolling his 4th run for office. #PA17"
76,"Oct 27, 2022","Huge corporations with too much power have been jacking up prices while making record $$. CEOs are openly bragging about it! 
I'll fight them. No more price gouging, no more lousy trade deals & stretched supply chains, no more crushing workers & consumers."

94,"Oct 22, 2022","Xi Jinping is a despot leading China's economic attack on America. Yet Jeremy Shaffer's business has been helping them build infrastructure. We've got to be fighting Beijing to bring back jobs to #PA17, not selling out western PA like Shaffer & his pals."
