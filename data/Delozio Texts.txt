I am honored and grateful that the people of #PA17 have elected me as their next Congressman to serve Western Pennsylvania in Congress. Read my full statement here:
|
Nov 8, 2022
Polls are now open, #PA17! I‚Äôm out here at the polls in Aliquippa greeting folks and making sure they vote blue today!
|
Nov 8, 2022
The sun might have went down, but we are still out at the polls here in #PA17! Go vote! üó≥
|
Nov 8, 2022
I ended the day at the polls at the place where it all began for me, in Thornburg where I grew up, where I learned the values I‚Äôll take to Washington. #PA17
|
Nov 8, 2022
Western PA made me the man I am today. From stepping up to serve this country in uniform, to fighting for our common good across #PA17, those values always guide me. And when I'm your Congressman, I will always put you, your families, and this country first.
|
Nov 8, 2022
I just joined my family to proudly vote for our common good, our freedom, and our shared prosperity here in #PA17. Together, I know that we can keep fighting to make America the land of hope and dreams for all of us. Let‚Äôs go!
|
Nov 8, 2022
Great to stop by the Eastridge Library in Wilkinsburg to see some current‚Äîand future #PA17 voters‚Äîas well! 
|
Proud to join @JohnFetterman and @giselefetterman to rally a massive crowd to get out the vote tomorrow. We're ready to win here in #PA17 and across the Commonwealth, and John and I are ready to serve. Big thanks to @EASCarpenters for hosting us tonight!
|
Nov 7, 2022
Corporate executive Jeremy Shaffer really can't stand to be asked about his business in China (or Saudi Arabia!). Corporations like the one that made him rich are raking in millions building up China's infrastructure & selling out folks from #PA17. Need proof? Here:
|
Nov 7, 2022
On the eve of Election Day, I proudly joined our next Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania 
@AustinDavisPA
 at our #TeamDeluzio campaign headquarters to phone bank! Less than 24 hours, #PA17! Let's do this!
|
Nov 7, 2022
Tomorrow, freedom is on the ballot in #PA17. I'm in this race to protect our rights to vote, to have a union, to make your own pregnancy and health care decisions, and so much more. üá∫üá∏
|
Nov 7, 2022
üö®üö®üö® Beaver County has published the list of voters who need to fix their mail-in ballots. If you voted by mail in Beaver County, please check this list! #PA17 
|
Nov 7, 2022
We have to rein in the corporate predators sitting on soaring profits and ripping us all off here in #PA17. When I'm your Congressman, I'll be fighting these giants in Washington. Let's win this!
|
Nov 7, 2022
My opponent ü§ù Hurting #PA17 seniors

If elected, Shaffer will join other radical Republicans to put Social Security on the chopping block and undermine seniors' health care by cutting Medicare. 

I won't let that stand. Our seniors deserve better.
|

Nov 6, 2022
It's despicable that Jeremy Shaffer would stand with Pat Toomey over veterans in #PA17, a guy who tried to block benefits for veterans like me exposed to burn pits in war zones. #PA17Debate
|
Nov 6, 2022
Great to have 
@francoharrishof
 join #TeamDeluzio for a canvass launch in Shaler this afternoon.

Only a few days left until Election Day‚Äîlet's do this, #PA17!
|

Nov 6, 2022
It doesn't matter if you teach, serve coffee, or make steel. You have the right to a strong union. And I'll stand with you, always. ‚úä #PA17
|
Nov 6, 2022
Proud to address everyone at Ebenezer AME Church and Greater Miracle Ministries today. I'm ready to serve for the good people in these congregations and all across #PA17!
|

Nov 6, 2022
I proudly served in uniform with 
@BarackObama
 as my Commander-in-Chief. And I am extremely proud to have his backing in our race to serve the people of #PA17!
|
Nov 5, 2022
It was great to join the San Rocco Foundation for their annual Night at the Races event. The crowd at St. Francis Cabrini Church in Center Twp. was packed! Viva San Rocco! #PA17
|
Nov 5, 2022
Folks in #PA17 may be changing their clocks back an hour tonight, but that doesn't mean we have to move this district back 50 years by letting my extremist opponent ban abortion nationwide.

This election will determine our future. Go vote!
|
Nov 5, 2022
üó≥Ô∏èElection Day is just days away, #PA17üó≥Ô∏è. So make a plan to vote, vote for Democrats up and down the ballot, and tell everyone you know to do the same! 

Get more info ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Nov 5, 2022
I also caught up with legend and friend 
@francoharrishof
 at today's rally. Proud to count Franco on #TeamDeluzio! #PA17
|

Nov 5, 2022
I was honored to join 
@BarackObama
, 
@JohnFetterman
, 
@LindseyForPA
 and many others to rally today. Folks are fired up and ready to vote for Democrats who will deliver results for the hard-working men and women here in Western PA! #PA17
|
Nov 5, 2022
Great to rally with the Char Valley Democrats last night. Folks are fired up to defend the union way of life, to take on price-gouging corporations, and to stand up for our freedom in #PA17!
|
Nov 4, 2022
Shaffer didn't have the spine to be honest with voters about his support for Oz in the #PA17Debate, yet is standing on a stage with him today.

I don't know what Jeremy learned where he's from, but growing up in #PA17 you and I learned about honesty and courage.
|

Nov 4, 2022
Nothing better than a quick taco break at La Poblanita in Coraopolis‚Äîone of my favorites in #PA17!
|
Nov 4, 2022
Seniors in #PA17 deserve a Congressman who will fight for them and their hard-earned benefits. 

I will always protect Social Security and Medicare and take on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug costs‚Äîbecause that's what it means to put Pennsylvanians first.
|
Nov 4, 2022
We don't need right-wing politicians like Shaffer & Mastriano having anything to say about your reproductive & health care decisions. These extremists want to attack abortion rights if they get power & will lie through their teeth to get there. Let's beat em! #PA17Debate #PA17
|
Nov 4, 2022
We have to fight the corporate jagoffs ripping us off, sitting on record profits that we're all paying for. They already have enough yes-men working for 'em in Congress; they don't need another one like my #PA17 corporate executive opponent.
|
Nov 3, 2022
I risked my life for this country because I believe in America. The patriotism I learned growing up right here in #PA17 demands we fight for our common good. And I'm running for Congress to serve this country and all of us once again, always putting you and your families first.üá∫üá∏
|
Nov 3, 2022
Jeremy Shaffer and these extremists who tried to overthrow our government are a threat to our freedom. I won't give them an inch. #PA17 #PA17Debate
|
Nov 3, 2022
Honored to have the endorsement of the Pittsburgh Regional Building Trades Council. They support Republicans and Democrats but are proudly standing behind me in #PA17. 

I will always fight for the backbone of Western PA‚Äîour workers, jobs, and unions.
|
Nov 2, 2022
Don‚Äôt miss your chance to watch my big win in our only #PA17Debate!
|
Nov 2, 2022
Just disgraceful stuff from corporate executive Shaffer and his pals coddling our economic adversary and selling us out. #PA17
|
Nov 2, 2022
When I'm your #PA17 Congressman, I'll be fighting to: 
‚òëÔ∏èbring back our manufacturing jobs & supply chains 

‚òëÔ∏èend the lousy trade deals 

‚òëÔ∏èfight corporate price gouging
|
Nov 2, 2022
It was a great afternoon to knock some doors in Harmar. Spoke to a bunch of folks, lots of worry that the GOP is coming for Social Security. I won't let that happen. #PA17
|
Nov 2, 2022
These insane Republican threats to Social Security and Medicare would send millions of retirees into poverty. I'll fight them tooth and nail when I'm your #PA17 Congressman.
|
Nov 1, 2022
I think you should have the right to make your own decisions about your pregnancy  and health care, and I'll vote in Congress to protect abortion rights. [1/2]
|
Nov 1, 2022
Unlike the anti-abortion extremist I'm running against, you won't see me running dishonest ads about my record, lying to #PA17 voters. [2/2]
|

Nov 1, 2022
I joined 
@JoshShapiroPA
 and 
@AustinDavisPA
 at their Beaver County bus tour stop this afternoon. Our folks in Beaver County are fired up and ready to win! #PA17
|

Nov 1, 2022
Coming out of our big win in last week's #PA17 debate, #TeamDeluzio is really feeling the momentum‚Äîeven Fox News has seen the shift in moving the race rating toward us to win! https://foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-republicans-expected-control-house-both-parties-hold-pathways-senate
|

Nov 1, 2022
The future I'm fighting for in western PA is a bright one: more solid jobs, strong unions, a healthy democracy, and the freedom to plan your families and health care. My kids and yours deserve that future‚Äîlet's make it happen #PA17!
|
Oct 31, 2022
It was a great Halloween night in Aspinwall trick or treating with my three favorite Dalmatians and Cruella de Vil! Happy Halloween to everyone across #PA17!
|
Oct 31, 2022
While I‚Äôm disappointed the voters of #PA17 will not get another chance to see and hear the clear contrast between me and Jeremy Shaffer on a debate stage, I wish him a speedy recovery.
|

Oct 31, 2022
From unions representing cops to firefighters to prosecutors, I'm proud to have support in #PA17 from those who keep us safe and to be the union-backed candidate in #PA17. 

As a guy who was willing to risk my life for this country, you know I'll always fight to keep us safe.
|
Oct 31, 2022
Happy Halloween to everyone who didn‚Äôt try to overthrow the government!
|
Oct 30, 2022
Happy Halloween weekend! Our grassroots network is everywhere in #PA17, ready to win!
|
Oct 30, 2022
Grateful to 
@MadeleineDean
 for coming out to campaign with me in #PA17, but I had to remind her that she's in Steelers Country! #HereWeGo
|
Oct 30, 2022
Knocking doors with the oldest ‚Äî start ‚Äòem young! #PA17
|
Oct 30, 2022
Corporate Republicans like my opponent are always going to give huge corporations and guys like 
@JeffBezos
 everything they want. 

In Congress, I'll fight to rein in Big Tech and price gouging monopolies.
|
Oct 29, 2022
Did you miss the #PA17Debate last night? You can watch it tonight at 9pm on KDKA:

Oct 29, 2022
Thrilled to have

Oct 28, 2022
Corporate jagoffs don‚Äôt need another champion in Congress, you do.
|
Oct 29, 2022
Took the whole family up to the Oakmont Fall Festival to meet more #PA17 voters and hear the issues on their minds. You know what‚Äôs scarier than Halloween? Another corporate executive in Congress üëª
|

Oct 29, 2022
My kids also got in on the Halloween fun!
|

Oct 29, 2022
What an honor to have 
@ClyburnSC06
 in Wilkinsburg this morning to launch a huge canvass from Nancy‚Äôs Revival. Folks are fired up for the last 10 days! #PA17
|
Oct 28, 2022
I know first-hand what it‚Äôs like to serve in uniform, to be willing to risk my life for us, and I‚Äôll always put you, your families, and this country first when I‚Äôm your Congressman. #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
The Supreme Court has undone decades of precedent in Roe to attack reproductive freedom. They‚Äôve been attacking workers‚Äô rights for years and made unlimited corporate money free speech. People have lost confidence and feel powerless. We need reform! #PA17Debate
|

Oct 28, 2022
Jeremy Shaffer is campaigning with election deniers - people who will do everything to undermine our elections, our democracy, and the integrity of YOUR VOTE. #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
I have young daughters. I don‚Äôt want Doug Mastriano & Jeremy Shaffer to ever have a say in their reproductive or healthcare decisions. They are extremists who support national abortion bans & are threatening to put women and doctors in prison.
|
Oct 28, 2022
I will do everything I can to protect women‚Äôs freedom! #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
Jeremy, why do you refuse to denounce the insurrection? Why won‚Äôt you denounce the assault on our democracy??? Time and time again you‚Äôve had the opportunity and you have refused. People who won‚Äôt denounce it are a threat to America. #PA17Debate
|

Oct 28, 2022
Corporations need to stop ripping us off. Too many corps don‚Äôt pay a dime in income tax & ship our jobs overseas.
|

Oct 28, 2022
Republicans like Jeremy Shaffer are ok with that and have signed pledges to never raise taxes on these companies. This hurts western PA families and does nothing to bring costs down and bring jobs home. #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
The weapons of war that my friends and I carried in Iraq should not be allowed in our schools, our churches, or in our streets! Period. #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
I‚Äôm a parent of young children. Like every other parent, I want them to be safe. I will do everything I can when I‚Äôm in Washington to make sure local police departments and prosecutors have the resources they need to keep our children safe wherever they go. #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
Let me be clear - I totally support funding for local police departments! I know what it‚Äôs like to wear a uniform and carry a gun to keep us safe and am proud to be backed by unions for cops, firefighters, and prosecutors. #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
I‚Äôm not giving China a chance to undercut our workers and take our factories! I will do everything I can to bring our jobs back home to western PA where they belong! #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
Jeremy Shaffer has made a fortune building roads and bridges (even nuclear power) in Communist China. We need to get tough on China and invest in jobs and infrastructure right here in America! #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
Jeremy Shaffer - western PA is still waiting for an answer to this question. Do you or don‚Äôt you support Dr. Oz for Senate and Doug Mastriano for Governor? #PA17Debate
|
Oct 28, 2022
Tune in to the first #PA17Debate TONIGHT! Here is how to watch:
|
Oct 28, 2022
Today is National First Responders Day and I want to thank our brave neighbors who step up to keep us safe. From our police officers and firefighters to EMTs and paramedics, and every other first responder who answers the call to serve and protect others, thank you! üá∫üá∏
|
Oct 28, 2022
Honored to have the endorsement of the PA Professional Firefighters Association. As a guy who led firefighters as an officer in the Navy, and on National First Responders Day, this one means a lot. #PA17

ICYMI: "Chris Deluzio has walked the walk"
|
Oct 27, 2022
Shaffer campaigns with insurrectionists, takes money from insurrectionists, and has 20+ members of Congress who voted to throw out our votes in 2020 bankrolling his 4th run for office. #PA17
|
Oct 27, 2022
Huge corporations with too much power have been jacking up prices while making record $$. CEOs are openly bragging about it! 
I'll fight them. No more price gouging, no more lousy trade deals & stretched supply chains, no more crushing workers & consumers.
|
Oct 27, 2022
Four years ago, we experienced great tragedy driven by bigotry and hatred. We must continue to fight antisemitism everyday. 

Today, we honor and remember the victims of the Tree of Life. This town is #StrongerThanHate.

Oct 27, 2022
We beat the sunrise to talk with workers at the Beaver Valley Power Station alongside 
@IBEW
 and 
@GoIUPAT

And fueling up after at Beaver‚Äôs Cafe Kolache was a great start to the day!
|
Oct 26, 2022
I joined 
@chucktodd
 earlier today to talk about the issues facing folks here in Western PA and the things I will fight for in Congress. #PA17
|
Oct 25, 2022
Political leaders shouldn‚Äôt make decisions about anyone‚Äôs pregnancy.

Women should. Period.
|
Oct 25, 2022
It is disqualifying for my opponent to continue to seek endorsements from, campaign with, and be bankrolled and supported by insurrectionists, the very folks who voted to throw out our votes and who stormed the Capitol to violently overthrow our democracy.
|
Oct 25, 2022
I've pledged to join the For Country Caucus, a group of veterans from both parties in Congress, who are committed to working in a bipartisan fashion. We know what it means to put this country first, above party, & I'll always work across the aisle to deliver for western PA. #PA17
|
Oct 24, 2022
Proud to stand on the picket line with 
@AlleghenyLabor
, 
@Bob_Casey
 and the 
@PittsburghPG
 workers from 
@CWAUnion

@Teamsters
, and 
@PGHGuild
. I'll always have workers' backs in #PA17.
|
Oct 24, 2022
While these workers are on strike, I will continue to refuse to speak with The Post-Gazette. I will, however, speak with The Pittsburgh Union Progress (
@ThePUPNews
) and suggest folks check out their work at

Oct 24, 2022
No help from the Koch brothers & other corporate giants. No $1,000,000 self-funding from a corporate fortune. #TeamDeluzio is powered by working people. Every $ you can manage helps us reach #PA17 voters in these last critical weeks of the race. Thank you!

Oct 24, 2022
Today is the LAST DAY to register to vote. Head over to http://Vote.PA.gov to register + check your registration status to make sure you are ready to protect democracy in #PA17!   http://vote.pa.gov/Register-to-Vote

Oct 24, 2022
I pledged an oath to defend our democracy. 

My opponent has bent the knee to the man who is attacking it. 

That‚Äôs the difference in this campaign. #PA17

Happy Diwali!

Oct 23, 2022
I love how #PA17 communities honor my fellow veterans with banners‚Äîjust like Neville Island, where I was knocking doors today. (But watch out for that huge skeleton!) [1/2]
|
Oct 23, 2022
When you grow up around here, you learn the values of service & sacrifice that have shaped western PA for generations, where folks have always stepped up for this country üá∫üá∏ [2/2]

Oct 23, 2022
Corporate execs have been stiffing folks, crushing unions, & outsourcing jobs to China & all over the planet for way too long. [1/2]
|
Oct 23, 2022
When you send me to Congress, I'll be fighting to make em pay their damn taxes, to bring back our factories, and to give #PA17 workers a fair shot. [2/2]
|
Oct 23, 2022
People all across western PA are tired of getting ripped off. Meanwhile, corporate profits are hitting 70-year highs. 

I'm in this #PA17 race because folks have been gouged by greedy corporate profiteers and lousy trade deals long enough. 

It's time to fight back.
|
Oct 22, 2022
Xi Jinping is a despot leading China's economic attack on America. Yet Jeremy Shaffer's business has been helping them build infrastructure. We've got to be fighting Beijing to bring back jobs to #PA17, not selling out western PA like Shaffer & his pals.
|
Oct 22, 2022
Holy smokes, what a day. Thank you to all of the #TeamDeluzio volunteers who are making Knocktober a huge success. This is the energy we need to sprint through the finish on Nov. 8th! 

Can you join us to knock on some doors in your neighborhood? https://mobilize.us/chrisforpa/
|
Oct 22, 2022
So much is on the line this election: our right to vote, to plan our families, and to work and retire with dignity & security. This is a fight for freedom and for an economy that rewards work, not just wealth. Let's bring home a win for western PA families in #PA17.
|
Oct 22, 2022
Mastriano and Shaffer will mean more chaos, more conspiracy theories, more attacks on our government and our freedom. We won‚Äôt let their extremism win in #PA17.
|
Oct 21, 2022
#TeamDeluzio has had meet and greets all across #PA17 (just like tonight in Green Tree). Thanks to all the folks who have opened up their homes to host and rally voters for our common good!

Oct 21, 2022
üá∫üá∏ Stop relying on far-flung supply chains

Oct 21, 2022
Medicare, Medicaid, VA health care‚Äîall in danger if Jeremy Shaffer ever gets a vote in Congress. Let's keep that corporate executive out of Congress and his hands off your health care. #PA17
|

Oct 21, 2022
Proud to stand with #PA17 unions and workers, who know I'll always have their back. We don't need another corporate shill in Congress, we need someone from Western PA who will always fight for workers and the jobs to make stuff right here at home.
|
Oct 21, 2022
Thanks to the Port of Pittsburgh Commission leadership for a great briefing on the importance of keeping commerce moving on our rivers. I‚Äôll be working hard in Congress for the funding we need for our locks and dams and infrastructure across the board. Let‚Äôs get to work! #PA17

Oct 20, 2022
I had a great lunch today at Central Diner in Robinson with Steelers legend (and #PA17 voter!) 
@francoharrishof

|
Oct 20, 2022
This is the group that's plowing money into #PA17 for Shaffer‚Äîthe same group that wants to ban abortion, even for brutal cases of rape and incest. My opponent is lying through his teeth on TV to cover up his anti-abortion record. Just cynical and pathetic. https://prolifealliance.com

|
Oct 20, 2022
Like most in #PA17, I believe in upholding the Constitution and protecting free and fair elections. 

My opponent campaigns alongside extremists and traitors like Doug Mastriano and Kevin McCarthy, people who tried to overthrow our democracy in 2020.
|
Oct 19, 2022
Great to tour ATI Brackenridge and spend time with the 
@steelworkers
 members whose hard work makes the place run. We have the workers and businesses that know how to make stuff right here in western PA, and I'll always fight for our union manufacturing jobs in #PA17.

Want to know why your burger has gotten so expensive? Four giant meatpacking companies control 85% of the market, and they're setting prices, ripping us off, and making fat profits. [1/2]

Honored to have the endorsement of 
@Steamfitters449
, like the 
@Boilermakers154
, 
@WpaLaborers

They know that party matters less than standing up for workers, jobs, and the union way of life. Thank you!
|
Oct 19, 2022
Huge corporate super PACs are attacking us because they're scared of losing power, they're afraid of a veteran like me who will always put western PA and our common good first. 

If you can manage, please support our fight and let's win in November!
|
Oct 19, 2022
Jeremy Shaffer‚Äôs cynical dishonesty about his anti-abortion extremism is plain for all to see. 

I am the only candidate in #PA17 who will protect abortion rights and women‚Äôs freedom to make their own decisions.

Oct 19, 2022
Journalists call out Shaffer for lying to voters about his anti-abortion views‚Ä¶

Shaffer: ‚ÄúNo comment‚Äù

Oct 18, 2022
Voters were willing to brave the cold tonight in the Quaker Valley! Thanks for coming out to learn about this campaign and our fight for the common good in #PA17.
|
Oct 18, 2022
Shaffer KNOWS his extremist views on choice are hurting him. Now he's lying to save his sinking campaign. The Pro-Life Alliance is 100% behind him, even sending mail to help, bc they know he'll always vote for Life at Conception bills (outlawing abortion, with no exceptions.)
|
Oct 18, 2022
Shaffer and his radical allies will stop at nothing to take away your reproductive freedom, and we have to fight back. Can you chip in today help us combat his disinformation campaign?
|
Oct 18, 2022
I stand with the 
@PGHGuild
 and Post-Gazette workers on strike. They deserve a heck of a lot better from a newspaper that their work has made one of the best in the country!
|
Oct 18, 2022
Growing up right here in western PA, I learned the values we all know: hard work, service, love of country. 

Those values shaped who I am, they drove me to answer the call to wear the uniform after 9/11, and they will always guide me as your #PA17 Congressman.
|
Oct 18, 2022
Proud to have outraised my corporate executive opponent 2:1. 

Despite Shaffer plowing a million bucks of his personal fortune into this race, he can't keep up with our grassroots power. 

#TeamDeluzio is sprinting to the finish! #PA17

Oct 17, 2022
It's been inspiring to see so many folks across #PA17 standing up to fight the radical anti-women and anti-family agenda of Jeremy Shaffer & Doug Mastriano. Let's win this!

Oct 17, 2022
Corporate greed is hurting working families, plain and simple. And I'm gonna fight it in Washington. #PA17

Oct 17, 2022
I had a great time speaking with RMU students, who are fired up and ready to fight for their future right here in #PA17!

A Steelers win + great meet & greet with voters in Glen Osborne make a pretty darn good end to a pretty darn good weekend in #PA17 for #TeamDeluzio.

Knocktober is in full swing! Thank you to the SWPA Grassroots coalition for organizing multiple canvasses across #PA17 today. We‚Äôre feeling the momentum!

Jeremy Shaffer is showing you exactly who he is: Campaigning with insurrectionists, courting endorsements from extremists, and begging for money from the radical right.
|
Oct 13, 2022
Feeling the love in Beaver tonight! #TeamDeluzio is meeting with voters across #PA17, who love this country, who are committed to fighting for this democracy of ours and our freedom.
|
Oct 13, 2022
We have a clear contrast in #PA17. The other guy wants to ban abortion (even for rape/incest victims), to take away your freedom to make your own decisions about your family and your healthcare. Jeremy Shaffer is too extreme for many in his own party and a threat to your rights.

Oct 13, 2022
Great to spend some time at 
@RMU
 today speaking with political science students about their future in #PA17. Thanks for the insightful questions!

This is a campaign for our common good. And I'll keep fighting to protect and expand Social Security from right-wing attacks, so everyone can retire with the dignity they've earned.

Doug Mastriano's bigotry, this antisemitism, is disgusting. It's a vile insult to our Jewish neighbors. And politicians who remain silent in the face of this hate have no place representing #PA17.

The energy in the room for tonight's

 union rally was real. Working families are fired up to fight right here in #PA17 for the union way of life. Couldn‚Äôt be prouder to have your support!

Jeremy Shaffer would love for you to forget that he would be "honored" to get Trump's endorsement. 

Shameful stuff.
|
Oct 11, 2022
The labor movement gave us Social Security, overtime pay, and weekends. And we know that strong unions lead to greater prosperity and freedom for our entire community. So I couldn't be prouder to be the union-backed candidate in the race for #PA17.

It's been a while since I bowled as a kid in a league at Crafton Ingram Lanes, but it was great as always to be there tonight.

I am so proud of the broad coalition of grassroots support powering this campaign. Together, we are sending a clear message: #PA17 wants someone to fight for working families and union members, not corporations and billionaires.
|
Oct 5, 2022
We all know that China is our economic adversary. 

I wore the uniform & led Americans at sea to keep Communist China at bay. 

My opponent? He made millions from a corporation building infrastructure in China. We can't trust these corporate executives who've sold out western PA.

We have to be ready for these attacks and efforts to weaken our democracy from right-wing election deniers and conspiracy theorists. I know that folks in #PA17 (whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent) refuse to let these extremists win.

I was willing to risk my life for our rights, so you know I'll fight to protect reproductive freedom. 

My opponent? He'll try to put an abortion ban in the Constitution and wants to force rape and incest victims (even kids) to give birth.

I hope that as we look back on the last twenty-one years since the 9-11 attacks, we honor the memories of the Americans we lost. That we do justice to their sacrifice by rededicating ourselves to this country and all her promise. 

America is worth fighting for.

No need to catch my opponent on a hot mic, his extremist views are out there for all to see. He supports putting an abortion ban in the Constitution, and even opposes exceptions for victims of rape and incest. Way too extreme for western PA.

There are a lot great policies for #PA17 in The Inflation Reduction Act. It's a bill that would ramp up clean energy and lower the cost of medicine, save people $ and help tackle inflation ‚Äì all paid for by the ultra-rich and corporations.
|
Aug 3, 2022
It includes serious incentives for wind, solar, and more. That means big support for the kind of manufacturing projects we're already seeing in the region, like the recently REOPENED Bethlehem Steel facility in Leetsdale:

Aug 3, 2022
There is strong support for nuclear power, like the critically important Beaver Valley Power Station in #PA17 that is a major source of union jobs and reliable power for the region.
|
Aug 3, 2022
The bill also has incentives to invest in emerging tech like carbon capture/storage and hydrogen fuels that could be huge for western PA. And a related measure will speed up the process for approving key energy infrastructure, keeping our energy security strong.
|
Aug 3, 2022
It will crack down on corporations paying little to nothing in taxes by creating a 15% minimum tax on huge corporations, ending their ability to avoid taxes despite massive profits.
|
Aug 3, 2022
Like the name says, it will take a huge chunk out of the deficit:  over $300 billion, according to early estimates.

My right-wing opponent wants to put an abortion ban in the Constitution, and is on the record opposing exceptions for rape and incest victims. He and his pals Dr. Oz & Doug Mastriano are too extreme for #PA17. Let's win this @JoshShapiroPA

My catching days are long over, but I'm still a proud Crusader. I learned a lot behind the plate (and had the bruises to show for it!), and growing up here made me the man I am today. I love west PA and will give it all I've got to represent us well in DC.

Corporate Dark Money PACs are already planning to make this one of the most expensive midterm election seasons in history, and #PA17 is a major battleground. Please, help us rally our neighbors against an onslaught of $$$ meant to weaken our democracy.

üßµToday we celebrate the 57th anniversary of Medicare + Medicaid. LBJ signed the bill. But because Harry Truman (love him!) fought so hard for healthcare as President, Johnson not only invited him to the ceremony, he held the signing at the Truman Library in Independence, MO.

"I am so proud that this has come to pass in the Johnson administration. But it was really Harry Truman of Missouri who planted the seeds of compassion and duty which have today flowered into care for the sick, and serenity for the fearful." - Lyndon Johnson

Harry Truman's work isn't done. 

When I get to Washington, I'll protect Medicare and Medicaid from Republican cuts and fight for decent healthcare for every American. #GiveEmHell

We need to protect our economy from the greed and vanity of the Big Tech monopolies. I'm looking forward to taking them on in Washington.

Politicians with non-public info trading stocks of companies the Congress needs to regulate...it's ridiculous. And it undermines trust in government. We've got to ban this trading by members of Congress and spouses.

Don't believe in fairy tales like "trickle down economics," folks.

I'd have voted for this bill. It will make us more competitive with China in the critical semiconductor industry and crank up production here at home. Anybody surprised that 89% of House Republicans voted against the bill?

It's greed, folks...

"Essentially what's going on is that big corporations are using the cover of inflation to jack up their prices beyond what their input costs would justify and rake in those profits, and consumers are paying the price."

I‚Äôve said it once and I‚Äôll say it again: @SenToomey

These right-wing attacks on elections are continuing, all designed to keep fueling the Big Lie. I first swore an oath to the Constitution as a 17-year old, and I'm just as committed today to protecting our democracy. I won't give 'em an inch.

Jul 27, 2022
Just wrapped up a great roundtable with the hardworking folks at @steelworkers
. We discussed both the challenges and the amazing opportunities facing us in #PA17.
|
Jul 27, 2022
We discussed the soaring cost of living, and how Republicans are blocking pro-family and pro-worker solutions that would fix our supply chains, protect folks from price gouging, and lower prices.
|
Jul 27, 2022
We talked about how to protect workers from the predatory trade practices of our economic rivals, and how the Federal government can step up for threatened and displaced workers & businesses.
|
Jul 27, 2022
Protecting retirement benefits and making healthcare less of a ripoff was a top priority for many, and I stressed my commitment to lower medical costs and fight against Republican cuts to Social Security & Medicare.
|
Jul 27, 2022
We talked about how the region can keep and GROW our manufacturing sector with the energy jobs of today and tomorrow.
|
Jul 27, 2022
And as always, we discussed how to protect the common good and the union way of life in an era of runaway corporate greed.
|
Jul 27, 2022
This western PA guy couldn't be prouder to have the @steelworkers
 backing me, and I'll always have your backs in Washington.

I'm running to protect and restore reproductive rights. My opponent? He wants to put an abortion ban in the U.S. Constitution (and wants to force rape and incest victims, kids even, to give birth). He's way too extreme for #PA17.
|
Jul 27, 2022
It's 2022 and the minimum wage is still $7.25. That's absurd.

I'll work to protect unions and workers from this kind of shameful, underhanded crap.

Washington allowed a small handful of companies to take control of our entire food industry. The results are exploding prices for working families, dysfunctional supply chains, and massive $$$ for executives.

We're fighting for votes in every corner of #PA17, and we need your help. Whether it's in person or over the the phone, people are powering this campaign and we wouldn't have it any other way. Thank you!

A good start in PA, but we need federal action too. Whether it's opening up banking for these businesses or making sure doctors can prescribe medical marijuana to my fellow veterans at the VA, we need to legalize cannabis federally to move forward.

Greedy corporate bosses and their bootlicker politicians shipped our jobs overseas and tried to kill unions and small businesses for decades. They don't care about the common good or western PA or putting the people of this country first. It's all about $$$$ for these jagoffs.

Butch Lewis Act in the American Rescue Plan was a huge win: over a million workers can retire with the pensions they were promised, thanks to the Democrats (no GOP votes). I'll always fight to protect pensions + retirement security in PA. #ButchLewisAct

Jul 21, 2022
It's one thing to say you're mad about inflation. It‚Äôs another to actually have a plan. Everyone is feeling squeezed, and corporate greed, outsourcing, and far-flung supply chains are to blame. Let‚Äôs put people over profit, make stuff here again, and do it with union workers.

I joined the @PaDems

And the contrast with my right-wing opponent couldn‚Äôt be starker:

Jul 15, 2022
he supports a constitutional amendment to ban abortion and is on record wanting rape and incest victims (children even) subject to his abortion bans. Folks in #PA17 want nothing to do with this extremism.
|
Jul 14, 2022
My extremist right-wing opponent believes in a nationwide ban on abortion and is on the record wanting rape & incest victims to be forced to give birth. He's dangerous, out of touch, and a threat to freedom. [1/2]

Life is a rip-off right now. Period. 

To bring down costs, we have to take on the corporate greed that's gouging us + start making stuff here again instead of relying on supply chains to China.
